{: .no_toc}

## ** About I2 ðŸ§ **
I founded **Interactive Intelligence (I2)** as an undergraduate organization at the University of Washington to **bridge the gap between AI, neuroscience, and ethics**.  

Through **discussions, research projects, and outreach**, I2 empowered students from **all backgrounds** to engage with cutting-edge AI concepts.

### **My Leadership & Impact**
- Built a team of passionate students to explore AIâ€™s intersection with neuroscience and ethics.
- Helped create our flagship Intro to NeuroAI course, making NeuroAI basics accessible to all UW students, and teaching up to 100 per quarter!
- Led community-driven research projects on AI safety, cognition, and interpretability.
- Organized lectures, workshops, and reading groups to help students engage with technical and ethical aspects of AI.

I2 continues to be an interdisciplinary hub for students passionate about AI and its impact on society.
