# Chaytan Inman for Governor – 2024 Campaign
{: .no_toc}

## **🏔️ Giving Rights to the Earth**
One of the cornerstone policies of my campaign was **granting legal rights to nature**. Inspired by successful environmental legal frameworks in Ecuador, New Zealand, and other places, this approach would:
- **Recognize ecosystems as legal entities** with the ability to be defended in court.
- **Prevent corporate exploitation of natural resources** by making environmental destruction legally actionable.
- **Shift environmental protections from reactive to proactive**, prioritizing the health of Washington’s forests, rivers, and air.

Washington’s natural beauty is a core part of its identity, and it’s time our legal system reflected that.

## **🚀 Tech & AI for the Public Good**
As someone with deep experience in AI, I wanted Washington to lead in **ethical AI development** by:
- **Regulating AI in hiring, policing, and surveillance** to prevent bias.
- **Investing in open-source AI** for public research instead of corporate monopolies.
- **Bridging the digital divide** by expanding access to tech education.

Technology should serve **the people, not profit-driven corporations**.

## **🌱 Final Thoughts**
This campaign wasn’t just about winning an election—it was about shifting the conversation. While I didn’t take office, the ideas we championed remain as urgent as ever.

If you believe in these principles, keep organizing. **Change doesn’t start in the Governor’s office—it starts with us.**
