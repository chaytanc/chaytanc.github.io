# Chaytan Inman for Governor ‚Äì 2024 Campaign
{: .no_toc}

## **Ô∏èGiving Rights to the Earth**
One of the cornerstone policies of my campaign was **granting legal rights to nature**. Inspired by successful environmental legal frameworks in Ecuador, New Zealand, and other places, this approach would:
- Recognize ecosystems as legal entities with the ability to be defended in court.
- Prevent corporate exploitation of natural resources by making environmental destruction legally actionable.
- Create a statewide agency to allow everyday people to represent their local ecologies.
- Shift environmental protections from reactive to proactive, prioritizing the health of Washington‚Äôs forests, rivers, and air.

Washington‚Äôs nature is a core part of our identity and values, and we need our legal system to reflect that.

## **Tech & AI for People**
As someone with deep experience in AI, I wanted Washington to lead in ethical AI development by:
- Regulating AI in data ownership, policing, and surveillance.
- Preventing new AI corporate monopolies from forming.
- Bridging the digital divide by expanding access to tech education.

Technology should serve the people, not profit-driven corporations.

## **Final Thoughts**
This campaign wasn‚Äôt just about winning an election ‚Äî it was about shifting the conversation. While I didn‚Äôt take office, the ideas we championed remain as urgent as ever.

If you believe in these principles, keep organizing. There is lots to be done. And do reach out if you need a hand :/)
