# Deinforcement Learning – Rethinking RL Assumptions
{: .no_toc}

## **Summary**
In our paper, we introduce the concept of **Deinforcement Learning (DL)**, which challenges the fundamental assumptions behind reinforcement learning (RL), specifically proposing pain-based learning algorithms rooted in neuroscience and cognitive science.

### **Key Insights**
- Deinforcement Learning questions reward-driven paradigms in AI.
- It proposes alternative learning frameworks inspired by cognitive neuroscience.
- Our study discusses implications for AI safety, ethics, and general intelligence.
