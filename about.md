Born in Portland. Went to Beaverton High School; go Beavers! Joined robotics in high school where the amazing people had an outsized impact on me. Very grateful to my experiences in the entirety of my education so far, good and bad.  

In 2024 I obtained my Bachelor's of Computer Science at the University of Washington studying Computer Science, with minors in French, Entrepreneurship, and European Studies.  

In the past, I've worked in two research labs: Adey Lab at OHSU and Freedman Lab at the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine at UW. I learned much about biological research, single cell sequencing, and STEM cell research at these internships.  

One of my proudest accomplishments as an undergraduate, I founded and led an undergraduate organization called Interactive Intelligence or I2. I2 fuses neuroscience, ethics, AI, and machine learning, and makes these subjects accessible to everyone!
Although now retired, I remain extremely proud of the team [which you can find here.](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io){:target="_blank"}  

I've worked as a software engineer in several contexts, including work at Meta and Apple, often focusing on developing AI based applications and production ready code.  
  
In 2024 I ran for governor of Washington in 2024. I campainged on a platform of giving rights to the Earth, because I think we are not addressing environmental issues effectively or quickly enough and I think our economic system exploits the Earth. The campaign website is at [chaytan2024.com](https://chaytan2024.com) if you're interested. Spread the word!  

Now I'm a graduate student, still at the University of Washington but now at the Jackson School of International Studies. Currently researching advanced natural language processing techniques to trace disinformation on social media. 

Thanks for reading :\)
